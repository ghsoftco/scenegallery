deep/cascading copy?
arbitrary axis rotation
copy more features from sketchup
show other model views (maybe hover-over, maybe radio box, maybe only for selected)
cleanup right hand panel (thumbnail is pretty isolated)
parse and use HTML description, view/downloads, rating
better list of things in ppls rooms
more aggressive caching
display the version so ppl can know if they're out of date (possibly with a note that there is a new version etc. etc.) - maybe a new menu bar entry

**** UI Changes
toggle line mesh rendering on a per-object basis
scale transparency on a per-object basis
easy object size normalization (make objects same height etc.)
polygon & model count/stats for scene and selected model (and descendants)
the problem with mouse/render events is not that there are multiple threads (mutexing) but that C# is building up a giant queue and processing them very slowly, maybe switch to a timer system
reflection transform
FPS+WASD mode?

**** Backend changes
toggle non-axis aligned bbox mode (project points into XY-plane, find theta with best planar oriented bounding box)
update transparency to COLLADA spec ex. 1944938643bdb1dd56538cee362f80d0 (may be a sketchup 5 problem)
make simple poster from local image file
filter object duplicates by image similarity
subgeometry elimination
toggleable ceiling
transparent walls
deal with doors (ex. light switch occurs near doors)
export back to sketchup
final eye-candy rendering (maybe ask Paul how he did this)
redo edge lines (ex. fans)
_modelFromGeometryIndex is probably growing to absurd sizes (and is responsible for things being slow when moving objects around), could switch to binary search or a simple while loop
basic profiler
hybrid solution for picking - GPU for "pickingA" CPU for "pickingB" to remove need for PickMesh
update TextSearch to be more reasonable and incorporate TF/IDF

**** Projects
The use of MMR, diversity-based reranking for reordering documents and producing summaries (Maximal Marginal Relevance)
coarse object alignment - start off with just theta rotation, look for strong clusters, etc.
context search integration
