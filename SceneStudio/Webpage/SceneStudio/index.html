    	 <h3>About SceneStudio</h3>
		 
		 <p>
		 	SceneStudio is a simple 3D modeling tool for designing interior environments (such as bedrooms).  <b>SceneStudio is also a research project.</b> Every scene created helps us learn how people arrange objects in 3D scenes; we want to use this knowledge to build better, more automated virtual scene design tools.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	In SceneStudio, you model scenes by placing objects into an initially empty room. There are several rooms to choose from, and you can search for objects in our huge database of 3D models. The available objects range from large furniture all the way down to keys, pencils, and batteries--go nuts and make your scenes as realistic and detailed as possible. <b>The more diverse and detailed the scene, the more it can teach us about object arrangement.</b>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	Most importantly, have fun! You might make a virtual replica of your apartment or design your ideal bedroom. <b>When you're done, don't forget to upload your scene to our server with the "Upload Scene" button.</b> You can upload the same scene multiple times; we'll maintain the latest version of each unique filename.
		 </p>

		 <h3>Getting SceneStudio</h3>
		 
		 <p>
		 	Download SceneStudio here: <a href="SceneStudio.zip">SceneStudio.zip (Windows only)</a>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	Once the download finishes, just unzip everything and run SceneStudio.exe. That's it--no installation necessary.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	<b>SceneStudio requires an active internet connection.</b> It communicates with our server to download models and upload finished scenes.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	If you decide to delete SceneStudio, be sure to delete the "cache" folder that it creates. Data SceneStudio downloads from our server goes there, and it can get quite large after a long period of use.
		 </p>
		 
		 <h3>Using SceneStudio</h3>
		 
		 <p>
		 	We designed SceneStudio to be easy to use. All of its controls sit on one toolbar at the top of the window. If you need help or want to know more about a particular toolbar button, just click the <b>"?"</b> button on the far left of the toolbar to open the Help window. Mousing over a toolbar button displays information about that control in the Help window.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
		 	Here's a quick video introduction to SceneStudio:

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Check out the provided sample scenes.</b> These are good examples of what you can build in SceneStudio; they might help get your creative juices flowing.</li>
			<li>Small "detail" objects add realism to your scenes. Light switches, power outets, and webcams are all good examples of "detail" objects.</li>
			<li>Our model database is big, but it doesn't have everything. If you can't find the exact object you're looking for (i.e. a poster with the perfect image on it), try to use the best available one. We find that designing with SceneStudio is more fun and fluid when we work this way. We also update our database periodically with models that people are searching for but not finding.</li>
			<li>Some objects in our database aren't properly "axis-aligned." If you find an object that you want to rest flat against a surface but can't rotate correctly, try to find a similar model that does work.</li>
			<li>Some SceneStudio controls have modifiers. For instance, you can hold "Shift" to scale/rotate by smaller increments. Check the Help window for the full story on any particular control.</li>
